# **Introspective Journaling**

One great example of introspective journaling is the Daily Morning Pages as described in the book, “The Artist’s Way”.

  1. Set a goal for how much to write, 2 pages or 500 words are good targets.

  2. Create a ritual — do it at the same time each day. Many people prefer to do it first thing in the morning.

  3. Try to keep the pen moving, just write down anything that comes to mind. Nothing is off limits.

  4. Do not filter, feel free to throw it out after if that helps.




The second category is more practical. Goal oriented journaling is a form of note taking. This is when journaling is used as a tool. It tends to be forward looking. Typically the journaling has some external goal or purpose. It’s fundamentally about self improvement.

Some examples goal oriented are bullet journaling, Benjamin Franklins Daily Virtues journal, and Ray Dalio’s Principles journal.
