Time can go fast. Really it only goes slow when we are very much “living in the moment” \#russelBrand \#brunch. But even then, looking back, it seems to have gone fast. 

What if we only lived for a single day? Not an infant mortality situation. Imagine the entire cycle of maturity and deterioration occurring in rapid sequence over the course of only 24 hours. Imagine you are trapped in this body, but your thoughts pass at the same familiar cadence. How would philosophy adapt in this world? Could we vindicate striving for the same things in such an abbreviated life span? Seems all you could do in such a short time is walk around seeing some things. I guess you would find a mate. You don’t want to miss that highlight of the day. What might you tell your visibly maturing kids in the short time you have to share? In this scenario, if you are born at midnight you’d be mature around 6 AM, and nearly out of school. You’d be pretty old by 6 PM. You might have kids a little after 8 AM, who hopefully move out by 1 PM or so. I guess the point of this thought experiment is that the scenario makes it harder to ignore reality and take things for granted. 

Here is a righteous and definite moral without two sides. Each person is no better, no worse than anyone else in terms of innate value and dignity. It’s a classicly Christian ethic. It applies to every gender, race, creed, and caste. It seems to follow that equalizing opportunity is a great cause. 

As a human, I love my family and have innate desires. From there I can construct a decision tree regarding how to live. In my opinion, reasoning alone without humanity tends to suggest a meaningless existence.
